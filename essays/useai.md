### I. Introduction


### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
For experience WODs, I did not think to use any form of AI because there were always detailed instructions, helpful clips, and youtube videos given to us as a resource. AI would not have been able to fully comprehend the assignment as it usually involves multiple steps and various specific files.  
  2. In-class Practice WODs
For in-class practice WODs, I did not use any form of AI because the purpose of this was to communicate with tablemates and classmates to work through problems. I would often ask questions and compare solutions with them. The in-class practice WODs were often similar to the experience WODs thus had a good idea of the task at hand.  
  3. In-class WODs
For in-class WODs, I did not use any form of AI because it was often similar to the in-class practice wods. I would also attend TA WODs for the javascript and functional programming which I found very helpful. 
  4. Essays
For essays, I would use AI to reword my sentences or paragraphs to make it sound a little more condensed and concise. I think for essays it is a great tool to check for errors, grammars as well. 
  5. Final project

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
I did not use any form of AI to answer questions in Discord because I did not often ask or answer any questions in the grou
  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
I did not use any form of AI to answer questions in Discord because I did not often ask or answer any questions in the chat. 
  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

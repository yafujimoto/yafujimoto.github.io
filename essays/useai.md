### I. Introduction
The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has definitely surged in recent times. Teachers and professors now have to implement AI detecting tools to catch students using AI in school assignments. Thus, the use of AI has risen controversy among a wide range people including teachers, professors, employers, college admission officers, etc. 
There are many different types of AI used for different functions such as ChatGPT, github copilot, AWS, etc. I have only utilized ChatGPT.
In this course, AI was openly acceptable for use for assignments, WODs, essays, etc. Although it may be a useful tool, it can also bite you in the butt. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
For experience WODs, I did not think to use any form of AI because there were always detailed instructions, helpful clips, and youtube videos given to us as a resource. AI would not have been able to fully comprehend the assignment as it usually involves multiple steps and various specific files.  
  2. In-class Practice WODs
For in-class practice WODs, I did not use any form of AI because the purpose of this was to communicate with tablemates and classmates to work through problems. I would often ask questions and compare solutions with them. The in-class practice WODs were often similar to the experience WODs thus had a good idea of the task at hand.  
  3. In-class WODs
For in-class WODs, I did not use any form of AI because it was often similar to the in-class practice wods. I would also attend TA WODs for the javascript and functional programming which I found very helpful. 
  4. Essays
For essays, I would use AI to reword my sentences or paragraphs to make it sound a little more condensed and concise. I think for essays it is a great tool to check for errors, grammars as well. 
  5. Final project
For my final project, I have found AI to be quite useful and helpful when trying to implement a new function I am unfamiliar with. It gives me guidance on tools that I may need to work with. 
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial
For learning a new concept, I have not used AI because I am a visual learner and often need an indepth explanation, I tend to rely on youtube videos for tutorials. This is why I often found the Experience WODs linked videos to be very helpful.  
  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
I did not use any form of AI to answer questions in Discord because I did not often ask or answer any questions in the grou
  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
I did not use any form of AI to answer questions in Discord because I did not often ask or answer any questions in the chat. 
  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
I did not use AI to give me coding examples as there are many better resources on the internet with more reliable sources. 
  10. Explaining code
In previous courses, I have found AI to be very short and conciser with explanations and often found answers or explanation to be off. AI is not always correct and I have found this the hard way and use this as an immediate resource for my academics. 
  11. Writing code
I definitely have used AI to give me an idea of how to start or implement codes at times. I don't copy and paste but sometimes will take inspiration. 
  12. Documenting code
 I have not used ChatGPT for documenting code. Documentation is primarily for the coders and having AI document would not be beneficial
  13. Quality assurance 
For quality assurance, I have sent it into AI right before submitting a WOD or an assignment to check for errors. 
  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
I have not used AI in any other way. 

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Incorporating AI into my learning experience has undoubtedly enhanced my comprehension and skill development. Through personalized content and adaptive feedback, AI has tailored my learning path, making it more effective and efficient. However, I've noticed a decline in my problem-solving abilities. While AI provides quick solutions, it sometimes hinders my critical thinking and creativity by making it too easy to find answers without thinking. In the realm of software engineering, AI has definitely raises questions about the balance between learning and getting the right answer. Despite these challenges, I strive to use AI as a tool to enhance my learning while actively engaging my problem-solving skills.

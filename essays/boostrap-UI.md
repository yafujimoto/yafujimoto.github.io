Web development uses tools such as UI frameworks to streamline the development process of responsive user interfaces. There are a wide range of UI Frameworks, all very unique and have both similarities and differences that differentiate them. They use components and templates that make web development more efficient and smooth sailing. 


I personally have very little experience with any HTML and CSS frameworks. Regardless, I found it to be very enjoyable and I had a good experience learning front-end web development with Bootstrap 5. I found it very straightforward and easy to navigate. Although I had many moments of frustration, there has been a consistent net positive learning curve. Itâ€™s very exciting to see my lines of code in HTML and CSS turn into a beautiful website. I do not have any experience with other frameworks such as Semantic UI or jQuery and am unable to compare my experiences but I have been enjoying the past two weeks of UI Design. I have been enjoying recreating existent websites to practice and hone my skills. 

I really enjoyed taking advantage of the prewritten components, layouts, and styles that made this web development process smoother, simpler, and faster that Bootstrap 5 offered. Bootstrap is compatible with many browsers and platforms making it very convenient for many users. The reload on the browser is incredibly fast when I make new edits and changes.

## My Thoughts on Javascript
With no prior experience using Javascript, I came into ICS314 under the assumption that it would be similar to Java. Boy, was I wrong. To my current knowledge, JavaScript is a scripting language mainly used for web and game development. Java, a compiled high-level language, is employed in server-side web development, Android app creation, and enterprise applications, featuring object-oriented principles and platform independence. I think Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective due to the versatility for front and back end web development and is one of the most popular and in -demand languages software engineers commonly utilize. Out of all the languages I’ve learned so far, I personally found C/C++ the easiest to comprehend, but I am excited to continue learning Javascript this semester. Each programming language serves drastically different purposes, nonetheless all very useful. 

## Athletic Software Engineering? WODs?
Unlike previous semesters, ICS 314 takes a different teaching approach by taking advantage of online resources. Using CodeCamp was an interesting way for me to learn the fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. Although CodeCamp provides helpful instruction and example problems, I felt as though the assignment was a little rushed and was not given adequate time to complete this assignment. There were roughly 140 topics and I personally believe I failed to comprehend everything given the circumstances. Ultimately, I found learning JavaScript relatively moderate in difficulty due to my prior experience with similar concepts in other languages. However, it was challenging for me to adapt to my existing knowledge to fit the nuances of JavaScript. The pedagogy of athletic software engineering through WOD’s(Workout of the Day) is an effective approach for my brain to actively stay on top of the course material. Although I do not enjoy the stress factor, I can see how the weekly WOD’s will be beneficial in the long run. I also do appreciate the open note aspect to check for syntax and little details we may have missed. The TA also provides weekly practice WODs which I hope to continue to attend every week. The limited time and 0 or nothing scoring will motivate me to do the very best I can every week.

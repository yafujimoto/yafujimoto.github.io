I used to believe when teachers would say that “there is no such thing as a stupid question!” My classmates, including myself, would often fire away with questions that could easily be found if a little bit of searching was done. We were often redirected to another website or google. Unknowingly, we were asking not-so-smart questions.
As a software engineer, it's common for us to encounter challenges related to code or computer issues. Whether you seek assistance from online sources such as Google or in classrooms from professors, asking smart questions is a crucial skill to have. The ability to pose well-thought-out questions is essential for obtaining effective and quality help. If you ask a not-smart question, you may be hit back with a “RTFM” or a “STFW.” Software engineers often work in collaborative spaces with other group members working to solve problems. Asking smart questions in this particular situation is important because they can elicit thoughtful and meaningful conversations as well as spark new ideas.

## Let's look at an example!

##### *I am trying to move my character but instead of that the player wont move*

*“I am trying to move my character. I wrote it just like in a tutorial(link). It doesn't work. My character just wont move. I do not see any errors neither! Did I forget to add something to my code - in the KEYDOWN section? So the whole Code is here but the problem probably is in the KEYDOWN section or the player coordinates. Here is the code: 
{INSERTED CODE}
Please tell me the code . If you just tell me what the problem is, I maybe wouldn't know how to fix it. It would be best if you could tell me what's wrong and then write the correct code (not necessarily the whole code, just the part I need). If then the real problem is me because I forgot something or made a typo, then I am sorry for asking this question.”*


## What's wrong with this question?

There are several issues with this question aside with the grammatical errors– 
First, let's look at the header. The header doesn’t explicitly and concisely state the description of the issue. No reader wouldn’t understand the issue without having to further look into the description. It doesn’t attract experts’ attention and can be easily dismissed. 
Now let's look at the question. Before asking a question, you should try to understand the problem and take diagnostic steps to figure out what the issue is yourself. You can clearly tell from this “question” that no additional steps had been taken, aside from the youtube tutorial. 
“It doesn’t work” doesn’t help anyone. You shouldn’t ask others to debug your code without attempting to understand where the issue is or what kind of problem they are looking for. 
A positive aspect of this situation is that the user demonstrated appreciation by following up and expressing gratitude after receiving a response. This acknowledgment helps foster a positive and supportive community or environment for seeking help and sharing knowledge.


## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.

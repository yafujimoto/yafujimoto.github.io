## My reflection on Coding Standards

Our focus this week revolves around implementing coding standards using ESLint within the IntelliJ IDEA software. Initially, I found the process of configuring settings and preference templates to be quite cumbersome. It involved downloading three packages, "esclintrc.js," "package.json," and ".gitignore," into the project directory, followed by installing ESLint, which consumed a considerable amount of time. Having to spend five minutes setting up each project seemed highly inconvenient and less than ideal. However, with repeated practice, the setup process became quicker and less time-consuming. Despite this improvement, I still wish there was a way to configure IntelliJ IDEA to automate this setup process just once.
When coding, I discovered a sense of excitement and fulfillment when I finished a homework problem or WOD with a green checkmark on the right side of my screen. However, reaching that point was often accompanied by frustration. Every space and indentation mattered significantly, and IntelliJ IDEA would promptly flag any errors or inconsistencies with a red error sign. Much like the initial setup process, adapting to this change has been a learning curve, leading to moments of frustration. Nevertheless, the satisfaction of eventually seeing that green checkmark makes it worthwhile.
In conclusion, while I understand the benefits that coding standards bring to software development, such as improved efficiency and consistency, I can't deny that it can be very disheartening to utilize at times. The meticulous attention to detail and the need for precision in formatting and structure can be challenging. However, despite these frustrations, I believe that the long-term advantages of maintaining coding standards can ultimately outweigh the cons, leading to better quality software in the end.

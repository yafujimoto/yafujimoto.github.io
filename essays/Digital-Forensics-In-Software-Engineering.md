## My Software Engineering Career Plan
I started playing minecraft in the fourth grade and that was where it all began. In Minecraft, players can use command blocks to execute commands and scripts within the game. This is a form of visual programming, allowing users to understand basic programming concepts like conditional statements and loops. This was my first interaction with software engineering. Minecraft provided an interactive yet fun environment for beginners like myself to start learning coding concepts while also tapping into my inner creativity. 
As of now, my primary focus and goals do not completely revolve around software engineering and coding. My intention as of now is to pursue a career in cybersecurity, with a specific emphasis on digital forensics. Although coding is not particularly a big aspect of this career, I believe that having these skills in digital forensics is not only valuable but also very essential for my professional journey. Software engineering I am confident that this skill set will play a significant role in shaping my future endeavors.
Professionals in digital forensics often need to develop or code tools to analyze digital evidence in the most effective way. This requires strong coding skills that I intend to obtain in this course, as I may need to write scripts or programs to create specialized tools tailored to the specific needs of a digital investigation. It also often involves investigating cyber incidents, which may include analyzing malware. Understanding coding is crucial for dissecting malicious code and  identifying its functionalities.
Coding is a fundamental skill for digital forensics professionals, enabling them to conduct thorough investigations and respond effectively to cyber threats. I will benefit greatly from developing and enhancing my coding proficiency to excel in this field.

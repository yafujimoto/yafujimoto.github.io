During my internship, I have undertaken the "one-woman" task of developing educational materials to enlighten various business units about their interactions with confidential information and the associated risks, including identity theft, reputational risk, and compliance risk. Through interviews and in-depth research across different bank departments, I assessed the level of risk and the types of information handled by employees on a daily basis. The resulting presentation for my department illustrates these interactions and proposes potential enhancements for risk mitigation.
My findings revealed that individuals across different departments in the bank have varying levels of access to confidential information. Moreover, the research provided valuable insights into overarching risks, such as identity theft. It became evident that there exists a considerable ease with which unauthorized individuals can gain access to personal and confidential information. Those with access to the confidential information can easily unknowingly give out confidential information throgh hacking and viruses. These discoveries underscore the importance of addressing security measures and implementing strategies to safeguard against potential threats to sensitive data.

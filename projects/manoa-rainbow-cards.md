summary: "Manoa Rainbow Cards, a professor trading card website!"
---

Our project: 
Manoa Rainbow Cards is a Trading Card Game is a TCG application thataims to increase familiarity and engagement between the students and professors of the UH Manoa campus. Each professor card comes with various contact information, projects/achievements and fun facts about them, which may also be traded between users of the app. This further fosters a sense of community on campus, and helps students connect to their mentors better in a fun and engaging way! Beyond trading, card availability is limited based on factors like the number of people who registered for the course, card waves being limited to each academic semester, and a random chance to obtain a particular card, therefore encouraging interaction and trade between users to get professor cards they want. By students of the UH campus interacting with each other, Manoa Rainbow Cards hopes to contribute toward bridging the gap between student and faculty member and unify the family of the UH system that much more.
I learned a lot about what it takes to be part of a group project at high stakes. I've been in group work for many of my previous courses but never had as high of a stake as this one. This definitely encouraged me to put in a lot of effort so I do not let my group members down and break trust. I had to stay organize and stay on top of assignments for other courses as well. I learned a lot about issue driven project management and how important it is to keep track of every issue you complete or are working on. Thus leading to my next important point about communication. I learned this was very important on keeping tabs on your teammates and holding eachother accountable for all of the tasks to be completed. I would say I made new friends because of this website and I am very grateful for it!

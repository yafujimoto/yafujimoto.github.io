In the course of our project, we were assigned the crucial task of testing and identifying potential risks to the Bank of Hawaii concerning business email compromise. To achieve this, we initiated a simulated phishing campaign by sending deceptive emails to all 2,100 employees. Through meticulous analysis, we identified and assessed the existing controls while pinpointing significant gaps within them. Our objective was to quantify the quality of risk and gauge the bank's susceptibility to compromise. Working collaboratively with fellow interns, we meticulously compiled our findings and recommendations into a comprehensive report, which we subsequently presented to the relevant department. Our assessment revealed a high residual risk, considering factors such as probability, impact scale, and the effectiveness of the current controls, as evaluated through a rigorous rating matrix. In light of our findings, we proposed potential solutions to mitigate these identified risks and enhance the overall security posture of the Bank of Hawaii.
